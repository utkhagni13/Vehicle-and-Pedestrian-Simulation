# Vehicle-and-Pedestrian-Simulation
This project displays a simulation of pedestrians' behaviours and actions while crossing a road or lane in presence of a vehicle coming towards them to avoid their accidents. Currently working on idea of simulating the model with multiple pedestrians and one vehicle.

### Steps to run the simulation
Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkhagni13/Vehicle-and-Pedestrian-Simulation.git
```

Install the PyGame modules
```bash
pip install pygame
```

Run the command at the correct folder destination
```bash
python code.py
```

**Try changing the pedestrian and vehicle constants defined in `code.py` to make simulation more fun.**
